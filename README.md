## Climate Change Monitoring

### 📱 Flutter Android App

The Flutter Android App acts as the interactive interface for the installation, allowing users to explore climate data and directly influence the physical sculpture’s behavior.

#### Key Features
1. **Real-Time Temperature Data**:
   - Fetches historical and current temperature data from the **GeoSphere Austria weather archive API**.
   - Allows users to select historical dates (from 1855 onward) for comparison with the current daily average temperature.
2. **Interactive Visualizations**:
   - Displays temperature differences through intuitive graphs and animations.
   - Real-time updates show how the ice sculpture responds to climate data.
3. **Bluetooth Connectivity**:
   - Sends calculated rotation speed data to the **ESP32 microcontroller** via **Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE)**.
   - Enables seamless communication with the motor control system.
4. **Aesthetic Design**:
   - A vibrant, rainbow-inspired UI reflects the installation’s theme.
   - Simple navigation ensures accessibility for all users.

### 🛠️ ESP32 Motor Control System

The motor control system, powered by an **ESP32 microcontroller**, translates the app’s data into precise physical movements, bringing the installation’s rotating ice sculpture to life.

#### Key Components
1. **ESP32 Microcontroller**:
   - Receives rotation speed data via Bluetooth from the Flutter app.
   - Processes data and controls the motor’s operation.
2. **Stepper Motor**:
   - Drives the rotating platform holding the ice sculpture.
   - Provides precise speed control to reflect temperature differences.
3. **Motor Driver**:
   - Converts ESP32 control signals into motor movement.
   - Ensures smooth and efficient operation.
4. **Freezer Box Integration**:
   - The sculpture rotates inside a transparent freezer box, symbolizing the fragile and frozen state of climate awareness.
